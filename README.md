# CC_Terrain_Adaptive
We propose a discrete dynamic programming algorithm with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme to model a terrain-adaptive cruise controller. The proposed controller combines the best driving practises of humans and the tracking ability of a conventional cruise controller. The code is in Julia. More details are as in the pdf.
